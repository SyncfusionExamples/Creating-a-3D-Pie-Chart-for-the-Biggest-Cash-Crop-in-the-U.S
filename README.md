# Creating a 3D Pie Chart for the Biggest Cash Crop in the U.S

## Description
The [3D pie chart](https://www.syncfusion.com/wpf-controls/charts/wpf-3d-pie-chart) is a visual representation of data that utilizes three dimensions to illustrate the proportions of various parts of a whole. In a 3D pie chart, the slices of the pie are distinguished not only by their angles and areas but also by their depth, resulting in a three-dimensional effect.

## Customization
We can customize the 3D chart view using properties such as [Depth](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.SfChart3D.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_SfChart3D_Depth), [Rotation](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.SfChart3D.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_SfChart3D_Rotation), and [Tilt](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.SfChart3D.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_SfChart3D_Tilt). Additionally, we can enable dynamic rotation of the chart in three dimensions using the [EnableRotation](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.SfChart3D.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_SfChart3D_EnableRotation) property.

We have enhanced the appearance of our chart by customizing pie series appearances using [CircleCoefficient](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.CircularSeriesBase3D.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_CircularSeriesBase3D_CircleCoefficient) and [Palette](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.ChartSeriesBase.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_ChartSeriesBase_Palette) properties.
